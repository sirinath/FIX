{"issuer":{"name":"FixSpec"},"doc":{"name":"ITCH Example"},"spec":{"date":1428451200,"version":"1"},"layout":"FIX","file":{"intro":"&lt;h4&gt;Introduction to ITCH&lt;\/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many trading venues have adopted a market data dissemination protocol known as 'ITCH'. While 'ITCH' is a registered service mark of The Nasdaq OMX Group, unlike the FIX Protocol there is no industry body which publishes an ITCH standard, so FixSpec have created this example specification from our analysis of numerous ITCH specifications in production around the world. Thankfully the venues which have adopted ITCH have re-used similar patterns and identifiers, so while the specifics change, the overall structures and patterns remain consistent.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;The messages and contents presented here are for a fictional equities trading venue and for illustration purposes only.&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Message Structure&lt;\/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ITCH messages are fixed-length in nature; fields are not preceeded by a delimiter or tag number like in FIX or SWIFT, but instead their start and end positions are indicated by an offset relative to the start of the message (where the first character has an index of zero), and the length of the field. For example a field with an offset of 4 and a length of 10 means that the field starts from the 5th character you see (remember the first character is zero!), and continues for 10 values. Take a look at the message here for examples.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ITCH application messages can be transmitted using a variety of TCP protocols, but our analysis indicates that most venues use the SOUP TCP protocol (currently managed by NASDAQ), and it is this SOUP protocol which handles many of the session-related aspects of an interface such as logon, logoff and hearbeat messages. Market data messages themselves are wrapped in a SOUP message for transmission as either Sequenced or Unsequenced packets. In order to provide a clear, easy-to-read specification here, FixSpec present standard SOUP messages for session items and present all market data messages wrapped in Sequenced data packets, which our analysis indicates is a common implementation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ITCH messages are typically ASCII or hexidecimal encoded. This example specification assumes ASCII message content to assist readability and understanding.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Timestamps&lt;\/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our analysis found two broad approaches to handling timestamps in ITCH interfaces.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;To include an explicit Timestamp field in each market data packet indicating the time in milliseconds past midnight in the timezone of the venue, OR&lt;\/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;To inject Timestamp messages into the sequenced data stream at regular intervals (seconds or milliseconds), and then recipients can use the guaranteed messages sequencing (possibly plus a further offset in the message itself) to calculate the timestamp of a message.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each of these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, but for the purposes of this example specification we assume that our fictitious venue follows the first approach presented above.&lt;\/p&gt;","header":"Example ITCH Spec","nav":[{"name":"Session","menu":[{"name":"Debug","id":"T_1035","msgtype":"+"},{"name":"Login Accepted","id":"T_1036","msgtype":"A"},{"name":"Server Heartbeat","id":"T_1037","msgtype":"H"},{"name":"Login Rejected","id":"T_1038","msgtype":"J"},{"name":"Login Request","id":"T_1039","msgtype":"L"},{"name":"Logout Request","id":"T_1040","msgtype":"O"},{"name":"Client Heartbeat","id":"T_1041","msgtype":"R"},{"name":"End of Session","id":"T_1042","msgtype":"Z"}]},{"name":"Orders","menu":[{"name":"Add Order - Short Form","id":"T_1043","msgtype":"A"},{"name":"Add Order - Long Form","id":"T_1044","msgtype":"a"},{"name":"Trade Break","id":"T_1045","msgtype":"B"},{"name":"Order Execution - Long Form","id":"T_1046","msgtype":"e"},{"name":"Order Execution - Short Form","id":"T_1047","msgtype":"E"},{"name":"Trade Message - Short Form","id":"T_1048","msgtype":"P"},{"name":"Trade Message - Long Form","id":"T_1049","msgtype":"p"},{"name":"Order Cancel - Short Form","id":"T_1050","msgtype":"X"},{"name":"Order Cancel - Long Form","id":"T_1051","msgtype":"x"}]},{"name":"Reference Data","menu":[{"name":"Stock Directory","id":"T_1052","msgtype":"R"}]},{"name":"EventCommunication","menu":[{"name":"Trading Status","id":"T_1053","msgtype":"H"},{"name":"System Event","id":"T_1054","msgtype":"S"}]}],"func_nav":[],"types":[{"name":"Alphanumeric","desc":"Alphanumeric text fields consist of alphabetical letters or digits (or both).
